    "For this week, we'll focus almost exclusely on a type of genetic variation (mutation) which we call \"SNPs\" (single nucleotide polymorphisms). A SNP can be thought of simply as a spelling mistake, where originally there was a particular nucleotide at a position in the genome (say \"A\"), but at some point there was a mutation (for example, changing the \"A\" to a \"C\"). \n",

    "A **genotype** is the combination of an individual's two alleles (since humans are diploid, meaning we have two copies of each chromosome except for the sex chromosomes). So for a T/A SNP a person's genotype can be either TT, AT, or AA. (At least for now, we don't care about the order of alleles in heterozygous SNPs. So you could also say \"TA\" instead of \"AT\".\n",
