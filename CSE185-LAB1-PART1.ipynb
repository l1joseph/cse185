    "A patient arrives in your clinic with a rare disorder. You expect the condition is genetic (i.e. due to a mutation in her genome). However since the condition is not observed in any family members, you suspect it could be due to a *de novo* mutation that occurred in the germline (egg or sperm cells) of one of her parents.\n",

For this week's assignment, many commands and template code are provided to you. In future labs, you'll be doing more of this set up on your own.\n",

First, you should look at the sequence files to verify the format is correct. You don’t want to open the entire files, you will just do a quick inspection of the first few reads. Use the `head` command to look at the first 20 lines in the first fastq file for the child genome (`NA12878_child_1.fq`). Replace [file.format] below with the actual path to this file. Recall from the excercises that the data files specific to this week's assignment can be found in the `~/public/lab1` directory.\n",

    "## 3. Aligning sequences to the reference genome\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sense out of these small sequences of DNA, we will map them to our reference sequence. Mapping works by taking each read and trying to find the closest matching sequence in the reference genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many alignment programs (\"aligners\") available. The earliest alignment algorithms (Smith Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch) are still used today to compare small pieces of DNA one-by-one, but the computing power needed to map millions of short reads to genomes that are millions to billions of basepairs long requires special algorithms to speed up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use an aligner called BWA-MEM, which makes use of the Burrows-Wheeler transform for reversible data compression (the reference is summarized with a special reversible index, the index makes it faster to search). BWA-MEM is optimized for ‘long’ next-generation sequencing reads of 100bp or more, which may contain several mutations, insertions, or deletions, as it works by finding the ‘maximum exact match’ within a read to the reference, rather than forcing the entire read to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to index the reference file. This step takes a while, so **it has already been done for you**. We created the BWA-MEM index by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "bwa index hg19.fa # don't run this!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This created several index files the program uses to rapidly search the genome. Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "ls ~/public/genomes/hg19.fa*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to see a list of those index files. Notice the `*` in the command above. This is a wildcard. We are telling `ls` to list all files that start with `~/public/genomes/hg19.fa*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to perform the alignment. We'll first look at the usage message for the tool to see how to run it. Simply type the name of the command.\n",
